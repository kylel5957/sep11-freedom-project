### MVP, BMVP, and Presentations
Previously, Me and Joe added levels, a trap portal, spikes, coins, and for our beyond MVP, a checkpoint feature. Me and Joe worked efficiently in order to bring the checkpoint feature into our game though we hit roadbumps along the way while trying to implment the feature.

#### Wrong/Broken Code

The problem with the code was that there were unnecessary code and the math syntax was wrong. First things first, one problem would be not adding "parseInt" to convert a string into a numeral number. Additionally, not adding the -1 at the end of levelWhat would bring you one level ahead of where you wanted be go to because of the 0-index feature of arrays-- our levels were all in one giant array. Finally, the biggest problem would be adding the start() as the code above it already did what start() does and adding it again would mess with the code. By changing all those problems, our checkpoint feature was able to work perfectly.

### Engineer Design Process (EDP)
In the Engineering Design Process, me and Joe have reached the finale as we have already completed the seventh stage which was to improve our products as needed. Now we have a finished product and so our paths going foward would be either continuing improving our product, or to start anew and make a new product for the future.

### Takeaway/Skills 

#### Problem Decomposition
Throughout the entire freedom project, everything was a big feature from the beginning to add. But through the use of problem decomposition, we brought those big problems down to little manageable problems that we can slowly tackle. As seen through the addition of the texts and problems, that feature was possible by first understanding how we would add text in kaboom, then we figured out how to add two portals into the game then coding it so that one killed you while the other won't. All these features were manageable because of the problem decomposition we put the problems through all while slowly deciphering [kaboom's documentation](https://kaboomjs.com/)

#### Presentation Skills
As we had finished our base game and even added additional features in our game to go above and beyond, we were ready to start presenting our projects to the class and eventually towards judges. Me and Joe had made [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mTrfeChYqEtcRuY7IsrA-1njXC6Yskf18GUQ0UwnznY/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) to showcase the features of our project and as we were presenting first, we set the bar for other presentations. As we finished presenting and eventually recieved feedback for our presentation, we learned that our presentation was nice but we should've put things in different order, with the "thank you" being the last thing that we say. This feedback was helpful for future presentations as we can in the future lookout for the same thing in the future, and it reinforced that we did well on the presentation and we should continue what we were doing. By consistently speaking with a loud voice, maintaining eye contact with the crowd, and tone changes, we were able to gain presentation skills for the future and elsewhere than the classroom.
