### MVP, BMVP, and Presentations
Previously, Me and Joe added levels, a trap portal, spikes, coins, and for our beyond MVP, a checkpoint feature. Me and Joe worked efficiently in order to bring the checkpoint feature into our game. As we had finished our base game and even added additional features in our game to go above and beyond, we were ready to start presenting our projects to the class and eventually towards judges. Me and Joe had made slides to showcase the features of our project and as we were presenting first, we set the bar for other presentations.

As we finished presenting and eventually recieved feedback for our presentation, we learned that our presentation was nice but we should've put things in different order, with the "thank you" being the last thing that we say. This feedback was helpful for future presentations as we can in the future lookout for the same thing in the future, and it reinforced that we did well on the presentation and we should continue what we were doing.
