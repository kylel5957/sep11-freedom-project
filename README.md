# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Kyle Lin**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript alongside a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to work together with Joe in order to help me make a platformer trivia game we named "Leap and Learn". Our project aims to educate students through fun means, and in our case, players answer questions while collecting coins and jumping over obstacles in order to reach the end.
