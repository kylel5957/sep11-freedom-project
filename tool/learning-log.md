---

### 9/30/24:
* Imported CDN for Kaboom.js
* [kaboom](../)
* Changed the positioning of the text and the text itself

### 10/6/24:
* Added NPM for Kaboom.js
* Tried adding a sprite into the code and so I added Mario
![alt text](image-1.png)
* Also messed around with the code and changed the variables to see if it would change anything
![alt text](image-2.png)
* Learned that `npm run dev` would start a local server like http-sever would but for Kaboom.js
* Note, scale(any number) will change a sprites size
* Note, functions and vairables are very useful becuase of how repetitive some of the code gets

* `rect(width(), 70)` --> This command allows you make a rectangle and when you change the number within width, you can change the width, and the other number is to change the height
* `outline()` --> This makes an outline which is exactly the same as a border
* `pos(0, height() - 50)` --> This line of code allows the rectangle to sit on the bottom but subtracts from 0 to allow us to see it
* `area()` --> makes so that it can interact with other sprites
* `body({ isStatic: true })` --> This makes the rectangle unmoving and anything can't move past it as well
* `color(200, 150, 255)` --> This gives color to the rectangle
