## Kaboom as my Tool

#### Why?
I chose kaboom as my tool because of the different possibilties each level can have and variation is what makes a game fun. I believe that kaboom is the right tool because of the ways you can make levels and how it can function as a platformer game or even an infinite game.
#### With Who?
I am working with Joe as we both envisioned a similar game using the same tools. We both hope to create an educational game that teaches something while being fun at the same time while that game is made and ran by kaboom.
