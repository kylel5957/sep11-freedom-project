## Context 

With a new year comes a new freedom project, this time using Java Script, and this year, I decided that I want to make a game, an educational game that is fun and can teach you something. I hoped that this time I would succeed and make an excellent game, working with Joe this time and not alone as we have similar intrests. After browsing through the tools, we thought about using Phaser or Kaboom as they were the best options for a game engine in our opinion. And so after thinking about it, [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) would be our main tool while [Phaser](https://phaser.io) would be our backup.

## Kaboom as my Tool

### Why?
I chose kaboom as my tool because of the different possibilties each level can have and variation is what makes a game fun. I believe that kaboom is the right tool because of the ways you can make levels and how it can function as a platformer game or even an infinite game. Additionally, I could possibly make a Mario Style game or a platformer game with many levels that can all have their educational value. Finally, it was very simple to setup and get started, making the choice easier to make.

### With Who?
I am working with Joe as we both envisioned a similar game using the same tools. We both hope to create an educational game that teaches something while being fun at the same time while that game is made and ran by kaboom. 

### Attempts
As I tried kaboom, I started off small like -->
* Imported CDN for Kaboom.js ([here](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/setup))
* Changed the positioning of the text and the text itself
* Tried adding a sprite into the code and so I added Mario

* Additionally, I added obstacles and implemented gravity and much more

* Overall, after [tinkering](../tool/kaboom-tinker/mygame/src) around, Kaboom seemed like a good fit, pick, and difficulty 

## Thoughts on Phaser (Backup Tool)
Additionally, as Phaser was our backup tool, I thought about trying it out and so I did. I looked online and scoured the web, not finding much, you had to download this and download that to even get started which I wasn't so sure about. The things I tried didn't work, but while browsing the official website, I found that you could import a demo game and so thats what I did. ([the game](../phaser/kylesgame)). I tried looking around in the code, seeing if I thought that this was something I wanted to learn and use, coding a new game, but I thought that it was too complex and difficult for my level Trying to change and tinker for Phaser seemed impossible and just the normal JS that was written spanned over 400 lines of code, with the complexity and difficulty, I opted to instead just choose kaboom as my main tool.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP) 
Right now, as we just recently started on the Freedom project, I am on the first stage of the Engineering Design Process, which is to define a problem. An issue that Joe and I thought about and recently realized was the problem of improving the educational learning of many who has a low attention span and a dislike for educational games. We also have thought about how a new game could be tailored towards new tastes of games.

## Skills 

Right now, some skills im already starting up to build is communication and how to google, throughout this entire process, me and Joe has been in communication behind the scenes finding different sources of information and ways to effectively tinker with Kaboom. And once we run into an obstacle, I sometimes ask Joe if he could help debug it for me or I try to research online for help, trying to learn in the process, taking into the consideration of how mistakes can be learning points. 

## Summary

As of this point, me and Joe are committed to making an educational game using the game engine Kaboom.js hopefully being very successful. I am confident in using Kaboom to make a fun and educational game and hope that as we consistently work on this project, my skills consistently grow.
