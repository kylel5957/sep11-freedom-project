## Context 

With a new year comes a new freedom project, this time using Java Script, and this year, I decided that I want to make a game, an educational game that is fun and can teach you something. I hoped that this time I would succeed and make an excellent game, working with Joe this time and not alone as we have similar intrests. After browsing through the tools, we thought about using Phaser or Kaboom as they were the best options for a game engine in our opinion. And so after thinking about it, [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) would be our main tool while [Phaser](https://phaser.io) would be our backup.

## Kaboom as my Tool

#### Why?
I chose kaboom as my tool because of the different possibilties each level can have and variation is what makes a game fun. I believe that kaboom is the right tool because of the ways you can make levels and how it can function as a platformer game or even an infinite game. Additionally, I could possibly make a Mario Style game or a platformer game with many levels that can all have their educational value. Finally, it was very simple to setup and get started, making the choice easier to make.

#### With Who?
I am working with Joe as we both envisioned a similar game using the same tools. We both hope to create an educational game that teaches something while being fun at the same time while that game is made and ran by kaboom. 

#### Attempts
As I tried kaboom, I 
* Imported CDN for Kaboom.js
* [kaboom](../)
* Changed the positioning of the text and the text itself

### 10/6/24:
* Added NPM for Kaboom.js
* Tried adding a sprite into the code and so I added Mario
